# How to run

### Procedure
0. Install [pixi](https://pixi.sh/)
1. cd to the directory of the project you'd like to run
2. Run `pixi install`
3. Open vscode in this directory
4. Open the notebook you'd like to run and select the pixi environment

### Why
For vscode to pick-up the pixi environment, the environment must be installed before vscode is open.
